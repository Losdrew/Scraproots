# ü§ñüå± Scraproots

ScrapRoots is a turn-based roguelike where you play as a lone plant trying to survive in a world ruled by machines.

You are a resilient sprout growing among the rust and ruins. The world is procedurally generated, so every run challenges you with new maps, enemies, and tactical decisions. To survive, you must take control of hostile robots, dismantle them for parts, and reassemble their modules to gain new abilities.
